# Speech Emotion Recognition Project

This repository contains the source code of our project that implements Machine Learning techniques and algorithms for a Speech Emotion Recognition Project.

It contains only one Jupyter file named *SER_ML.ipynb*. We have added comments in each cell and before the definition of complex functions.

If you want to run the notebook follow these steps: 
1. Open it in Colab using the embedded link
2. Use the data as we have modified them. You can find them at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JG8csrpCZ30BIujv13Y61AnYkasNHsaf?usp=sharing). You could create a shortcut of this location in your drive.
3. Create a copy of the notebook in your drive and run!

We recommend you use **a runtime with GPU** so ThunderSVM library can be used and accelarate the SVM computations.
